# **Research Experience**
### **Master‚Äôs Thesis** [pdf](/files/expansion.pdf)  
**Title:** Identifying Popular Products at An Early Stage for Apparel Industry  
**Cooperating Company:** Hangzhou Linezone Data  
**Institution:** Zhejiang University (May 2022 ‚Äì March 2023)  
**Supervisor:** Professor Qingwei Jin  

- Proposed a new indicator, AW Sales (Average Weekly Sales in Main Sales Period), to measure product popularity, unaffected by differences in store traffic, number of stores with initial stock, discounts, and product launch duration.  
- Developed novel features from weekly adjusted sales volume sequences.  
- Built a product popularity classification model using ranking algorithms, pioneering their application in sales prediction.  
- Achieved **78.9% prediction accuracy**, identifying fast-selling products **17 days earlier** than traditional methods.  

### **Undergraduate Thesis** [pdf](/files/flexibleBus.pdf) 
**Title:** Plan-Based Bus Bridging Strategy During Disruptions of Urban Rail Networks\\
**Institution:** Shanghai Jiao Tong University (February 2021 ‚Äì June 2021)  
**Supervisor:** Professor Jiangang Jin 

- Constructed an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model for flexible bus scheduling to support efficient passenger transportation during rail disruptions.  
- Developed a solution program using CPLEX to achieve optimal results.  
- Designed and implemented a heuristic algorithm in Python to accelerate solutions while maintaining a deviation of only **2.2% from the exact solution**.
