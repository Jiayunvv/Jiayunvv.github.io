# **Research Experience**
## **PhD Project**
**Title:** Resource flow optimization and logistics in Hubs for circularity [Project](https://is2h4c-project.eu/)
**Institution:** University of Twente
- Develop a daily operational model for a generic hub for circularity, managed in a centralized manner, which provides optimal decisions on production scheduling, transportation, and inventory management.
- Conduct a comprehensive literature review on resource flow management within concepts related with hubs for circularity, such as industrial symbiosis networks, and propose a two-phase optimization framework for managing flows of resources in space and time.

## **Master’s Thesis**   
**Title:** Identifying Popular Products at An Early Stage for Apparel Industry  [[Slides]](/files/expansion.pdf)  
**Cooperating Company:** Hangzhou Linezone Data  
**Institution:** Zhejiang University (May 2022 – March 2023)  
**Supervisor:** Professor Qingwei Jin  
- Proposed a new indicator, AW Sales (Average Weekly Sales in Main Sales Period), to measure product popularity, unaffected by differences in store traffic, number of stores with initial stock, discounts, and product launch duration.  
- Developed novel features from weekly sales volume sequences.  
- Built a product popularity classification model using ranking algorithms, pioneering their application in sales prediction.  
- Achieved **78.9% prediction accuracy**, identifying fast-selling products **17 days earlier** than traditional methods.  

## **Bechelor's Thesis** 
**Title:** Plan-Based Bus Bridging Strategy During Disruptions of Urban Rail Networks  [[Slides]](/files/flexibleBus.pdf) \\
**Institution:** Shanghai Jiao Tong University (February 2021 – June 2021)  
**Supervisor:** Professor Jiangang Jin 

- Constructed an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model for flexible bus scheduling to support efficient passenger transportation during rail disruptions.  
- Developed a solution program using CPLEX to achieve optimal results.  
- Designed and implemented a heuristic algorithm in Python to accelerate solutions while maintaining a deviation of only **2.2% from the exact solution**.

# **Projects**

### **Text Mining and Classifications in Yunduoduo** [pdf](/files/bert_yunduoduo.pdf) 
- Collected data from “Yunduoduo”, a social platform for college students and fine-tuned the BERT model to predict post sentiment.  
- Compared various machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Linear SVM) for accuracy and efficiency.  
- Proposed an automatic classification application prototype.  

### **Time Series Analysis of AQI in Delhi (2015–2020)** [pdf](/files/time_series.pdf) 
- Modeled and predicted Air Quality Index (AQI) for August 2019 to August 2020 using historical data from Delhi, India.  
- Utilized R for statistical modeling and forecasting.
