***Hello, and welcome to my academic page!***


I'm currently a 1st-year Ph.D. student at the University of Twente.Â 

In my spare time, I'm an avid reader and a passionate traveler. My favorite book is "Gone with the Wind" because I admire Scarlett's energy and her unyielding spirit. 

When it comes to traveling, I've explored several famous cities in China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Xiamen, Kunming, and Lanzhou. Last summer, I embarked on my first international adventure to Osaka, Japan, which left a lasting impression on me with its unique culture and breathtaking landscapes. I'm eager to continue expanding my horizons and experiencing the wonders of the world.


### Research Interests

My research interests revolve around optimization. 
My previous research experience included vehicle scheduling problems (ILP, heuristic algorithm) and product popularity ranking (data analytics, indicators, machine learning).


I am now focusing on resource flow optimization for hubs.
