  😁 Hey! Welcome to my academic page!
</div>


I'm currently a first-year Ph.D. student at the Industrial Engineering and Business Information Systems (IEBIS) group in the Behavioural, Management and Social Sciences (BMS) faculty at the [University of Twente (UT)](https://www.utwente.nl/en/). My research focuses on developing resource flow optimization models for hubs as part of the EU Horizon program ['IS2H4C'](https://is2h4c-project.eu/).

In my spare time, I'm an avid reader and a passionate traveler. My favorite book is "Gone with the Wind" because I admire Scarlett's energy and her unyielding spirit. 

### Research Interests

My research interests revolve around optimization. 
My previous research experience included vehicle scheduling problems (ILP, heuristic algorithm) and product popularity ranking (data analytics, indicators, machine learning).

I am now focusing on stochastic dynamic programming, with an focus on optimizing resource flows for circular hubs.


### Education Background
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Transportation from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China (QS ranking 51), and a Master's degree in Management Science from Zhejiang University, China (QS ranking 44).


### Experiencing the World

[Wrote in 2024.12: ] I realized a part of my dream this year! In 2024, I moved to the Netherlands, marking my first time living in a foreign country. I explored seven countries, including Netherlands, Germany, Greece, Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Norway. The world is vast, and I’m eager to see and experience even more!

[Wrote in 2023.11: ]
When it comes to traveling, I've explored several famous cities in China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Xiamen, Kunming, and Lanzhou. In summer of 2023, I embarked on my first international adventure to Osaka, Japan, which left a lasting impression on me with its unique culture and breathtaking landscapes. I'm eager to continue expanding my horizons and experiencing the wonders of the world.
