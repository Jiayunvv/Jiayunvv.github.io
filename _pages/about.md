I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at the Industrial Engineering and Business Information Systems (IEBIS) group in the Behavioural, Management and Social Sciences (BMS) faculty at the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/). My research focuses on developing resource flow optimization models for hubs as part of the EU Horizon program ['IS2H4C'](https://is2h4c-project.eu/).

## Research Interests

My research interests revolve around **optimization** and **stochastic dynamic programming**.

Previous research experience includes:
- Vehicle scheduling problems (ILP, heuristic algorithms)
- Product popularity ranking (data analytics, machine learning)

Currently focusing on optimizing resource flows for circular hubs.

## Education

- **Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering** - University of Twente (2024-present)
- **M.S. in Management Science** - Zhejiang University (2021-2024)
- **B.S. in Transportation Engineering** - Shanghai Jiao Tong University (2017-2021)

## Personal

In my spare time, I'm an avid reader and a passionate traveler. My favorite book is "Gone with the Wind" - I admire Scarlett's energy and unyielding spirit.

**2024:** Moved to the Netherlands, marking my first time living abroad. Explored seven countries: Netherlands, Germany, Greece, Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, and Norway.

**2023:** First international adventure to Osaka, Japan. Previously explored Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Xiamen, Kunming, and Lanzhou in China.
