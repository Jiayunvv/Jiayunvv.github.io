  😁 Hey! Welcome to my academic page!
</div>


I'm currently a Ph.D. student at the Industrial Engineering and Management Science (IEMS) department in the Behavioural, Management and Social Sciences (BMS) faculty at the [University of Twente (UT)](https://www.utwente.nl/en/). My research focuses on developing resource flow optimization models for hubs as part of the EU Horizon program ['IS2H4C'](https://is2h4c-project.eu/).

In my spare time, I'm an avid reader and a passionate traveler. My favorite book is "Gone with the Wind" because I admire Scarlett's energy and her unyielding spirit.

### Research Interests
My research interests revolve around optimization.
My previous research experience included vehicle scheduling problems (ILP, heuristic algorithm) and product popularity ranking (data analytics, indicators, machine learning).

I am now focusing on stochastic dynamic programming, with an focus on optimizing resource flows for circular hubs.


### Education Background
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Transportation from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China (QS ranking 51), and a Master's degree in Management Science from Zhejiang University, China (QS ranking 44).


### Experiencing the World
[Wrote in 2026.02: ] Last year was an amazing travel year for me. I visited so many wonderful places, including Paris in France, Brussels in Belgium, Alexandroupoli and Thessaloniki in Greece, Leeds and London in the UK, and Venice and Milan in Italy. In China, I also explored Chengdu and Mount Huangshan. Every trip brought new memories, and it truly felt like a year full of adventure and happiness.

[Wrote in 2024.12: ] I realized a part of my dream this year! In 2024, I moved to the Netherlands, marking my first time living in a foreign country. I explored seven countries, including Netherlands, Germany, Greece, Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Norway. The world is vast, and I'm eager to see and experience even more!

[Wrote in 2023.11: ]
When it comes to traveling, I've explored several famous cities in China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Xiamen, Kunming, and Lanzhou. In summer of 2023, I embarked on my first international adventure to Osaka, Japan, which left a lasting impression on me with its unique culture and breathtaking landscapes. I'm eager to continue expanding my horizons and experiencing the wonders of the world.
