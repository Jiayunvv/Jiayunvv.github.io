**Supervisor:** Professor Jiangang Jin

This project developed a flexible bus scheduling solution to support efficient passenger transportation during rail disruptions.

## Key Contributions

- Constructed an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model for flexible bus scheduling
- Developed a solution program using CPLEX to achieve optimal results
- Designed and implemented a heuristic algorithm in Python that accelerates solutions while maintaining only **2.2% deviation** from the exact solution
