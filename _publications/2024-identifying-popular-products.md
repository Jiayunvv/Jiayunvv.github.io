This paper proposes a new indicator, AW Sales (Average Weekly Sales in Main Sales Period), to measure product popularity unaffected by differences in store traffic, number of stores with initial stock, discounts, and product launch duration.

We developed novel features from weekly sales volume sequences and built a product popularity classification model using ranking algorithms, pioneering their application in sales prediction. The model achieved **78.9% prediction accuracy**, identifying fast-selling products **17 days earlier** than traditional methods.
